## How to use iTerm Config
* This is my custom iTerm Setup Configs about color Theme, mouse option, key options and many others.
* Only **MacOS** support (becuase iTerm2 support macos only).
* This **does not apply automatically** for the safety purpose. Follow instruction below for applying to your iTerm.

### Installation
```bash
cp .dotfiles/config/iTerm/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist
```
* It will replace your original iterm2 preferences setup. So, watch out if you want to keep your original setup.
* Use installation commend after install dotfiles.
